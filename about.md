Hi, I am a PhD. candidate in [Arizona State University](www.asu.edu), advised by Professor [Yu Cao](http://nimo.asu.edu/ycao/). I am mainly interested in deep learning, especially algorithm design and hardware acceleration.

During the course of my career, I have been very fortunate to have a taste of many diverse and fascinating fields of studies. I started with my undergraduation at [National Institute of Technology](http://nitrkl.ac.in/), Rourkela, India in the field of Electronics and Communications Engineering. After that I had the oppurtunity of working at Samsung Research Institute for 3 wonderful years. My stint at Samsung exposed me to many challenging projects on interesting topics like 3D stereoscopic rendering on embedded platforms, light weight and high performance widget engine using [Webkit's](https://webkit.org/) rendering engine etc. In the last 4 years, I took courses from many disciplines like machine learning, multi-core architectures, analog design, accelerator design etc.
I also did an internship at Intel Corp in 2016, where I worked on architecture design and implementation of deep learning accelerators for speech processing. I have also worked as an consultant for [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/).
