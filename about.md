Hi, my name is Abinash Mohanty. I work as a Machine Learning Apps engineer at [Annapurna Labs (Amazon AWS)](http://www.annapurnalabs.com/). I completed my PhD in [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu), under the guidance of Professor [Yu Cao](http://nimo.asu.edu/ycao/). I am mainly interested in deep learning, especially algorithm design and hardware acceleration. I love travelling and photography (this is my [travel blog](https://www.shootit.online)).

During the course of my career, I have been very fortunate to have a taste of many diverse and fascinating fields. I did my undergraduate studies at [National Institute of Technology](http://nitrkl.ac.in/), Rourkela, India in the field of Electronics and Communications Engineering. After that I had the oppurtunity of working at Samsung Research Institute for 3 wonderful years. My stint at Samsung exposed me to many challenging projects on interesting topics like 3D stereoscopic rendering on embedded platforms, light weight and high performance widget engine using [Webkit's](https://webkit.org/) rendering engine etc. I did an internship at Intel Corp in 2016, where I worked on architecture design and implementation of deep learning accelerators for speech processing. I have also worked as consultant for [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/) and [FABU Tech](https://www.fabu.ai/en). Did another internship at [FABU Tech](https://www.fabu.ai/en) in summer of 2018. After completing my PhD, worked as a senior design engineer at a startup called [FABU Tech](https://www.fabu.ai/en), focusing mostly on deep learning algorithms and hardware accelerators for autonomous driving vechiles.
