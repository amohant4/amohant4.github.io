If you’re in search of an incredible natural vista, then Horseshoe Bend is definitely worth a visit. The name was inspired by its unusual shape, a horseshoe-shaped meander of the Colorado River located four miles southwest of Page, AZ, within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. Just a hop, skip, and a jump from Glen Canyon Dam and the popular Lake Powell, the best view is from the steep cliff above Horseshoe Bend.

Antelope Canyon is the product of millions of years of water erosion. In fact, the Navajo name for Upper Antelope Canyon is “Tse' bighanilini,” which means "the place where water runs through rocks." Once home to herds of pronghorn antelope, the canyon now lies within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation, and draws nature-lovers near and far for its remarkable, mysterious beauty. The canyon walls climb 120 feet above the streambed, making it a cathedral of red-hued, swirling sandstone.
