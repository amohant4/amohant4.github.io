Learning rate is one of the most critical hyper-parameter and decides the fate of your training process. If you mess up the learning rate, then the optimizer might not be able to converge at all. Learning rate controls how much we updating the parameters in our network with respect to the gradient of loss. 

The gradient is given by: 

$$g = \frac{1}{m^{'}}\nabla_{\theta}\sum_{i=1}^{m^{'}}L(x^{(i)},y^{(i)},\theta)$$

Using this gradient from the minibatch, stochastic gradient descent follows the estimated downhill: 

$$\theta \leftarrow \theta - \epsilon g $$  

where $$ \epsilon $$ is the learning rate. 

```
new_weight = existing_weight â€” learning_rate * gradient
```

The following figure explains the effects of learning rate on gradient descent. A very small learning rate will make gradient descent take small steps even if the gradient is big, thus slowing the process of learning. If the learning rate is high, then if becomes impossible to learn very small changes in the parameters needed to fine tune the model towards the end of the training process, so the error flattens out very early. If the learning rate is very high, then gradient descent takes big steps and jumps around. This can lead to divergence and thus increase the error.

Now the question aries, what is the best value of the learning rate and how to decide it ? A systematic way to estimate a good learning rate is by training the model initially with a very low learning rate and increasing it (either linearly or exponentially) at each iteration (illustrated below). We keep doing it to the point where the loss stops decreasing and starts to increase. That means that the learning rate is too high for the application and so gradient descent is diverging. For practical applications our learning rate should ideally be 1 or 2 step smaller than this value.

If we keep track of the learning rate and plot log of the learning rate and the error we will see a plot as shown below. A good learning rate somewhere to the left to the lowest point of the graph (as demonstrated in below graph). In this case, its 0.001 to 0.01.

In general no fixed learning rate works best for the entire training process. Typically we start with a learning rate found using the method described above. During the training process we change learning rate to best facilitate learning. There are many different ways to accomplish this. In this blog, we will go through a few popular learning rate scheduler. 

### Linear decay of learning rate

In practice, it is common to decay the learning rate linearly until iteration $$\tau$$:

$$ \epsilon_{k} = (1-\alpha)\epsilon_{0} + \alpha \epsilon_{\tau} $$

with $$ \alpha = \frac{k}{\tau}$$. After iteration $$ \tau$$, it is common to leave $$\epsilon$$  constant.
